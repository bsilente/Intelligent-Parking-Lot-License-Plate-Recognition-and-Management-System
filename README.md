<h1>Intelligent Parking Lot License Plate Recognition and Management System</h1>

# :books: Project Introduction
The intelligent parking lot license plate recognition and management system based on FPGA is a product developed for the general intelligent parking lot. It uses advanced license plate location, character segmentation and recognition algorithms, combined with FPGA hardware acceleration, to realize real-time and accurate license plate recognition for vehicles entering and out of the parking lot. In addition, the system also integrates parking space detection, automatic navigation, reverse car search and other functions to provide a full range of parking lot positioning management. At the same time, the system uses intelligent design and integrates the automatic control system of the elevator rod to improve the user parking experience. This work uses the high-speed parts processing ability of FPGA to realize a set of intelligent parking lot license plate efficient recognition and management system, which solves the problems of low efficiency, high labor cost and poor user experience of traditional parking lot management, and contributes to the construction of smart cities.
